#### food class

We also need food class to feed the snake and get the score. If snake eats food, the length of the body is increased and get +1 score. The food appears at the random location.

```python
class Food:
    def new_location(self):
        global food_x, food_y
        food_x = random.randrange(1, width - scale)
        food_y = random.randrange(1, height - scale)

    def show(self):
        pygame.draw.rect(display, food_color, (food_x, food_y, scale, scale))

```

like I said before, if snake eats food, you will get +1 score. I will create showing score function.

```python
score = 0

def show_score():
    global score

    # create font(font, font-size)
    font = pygame.font.SysFont("Copperplate Gothic Bold", 30)

    # render font(text, anti-aliasing enabled, color)
    text = font.render("Score: " + str(score), True, (255, 255, 255))

    # draw text surface(text, (pos.x, pos.y))
    display.blit(text, (10, 10))

```

##### Learned New

I realized that I better separate classes and variables since the code file is quite complicated.
Variables file contains

```python
import pygame

# screen width, height
width = 500
height = 500

# for collision detection
scale = 10

# this should be global since snake class also need this variable
food_x = 10
food_y = 10

# colors
background = (23, 32, 42)
snake_head = (247, 220, 111)
snake_color = (236, 240, 241)
food_color = (148, 49, 38)

# to handle events, draw graphics, and manage the display within the window.
display = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
```

and to use these variables(variables.py),

```python
from variables import *
```
