If you use github, you may know when you commit, the small square will be filled green.

In Korea, we call this planting grass because filling the square green seems like planting grass. The more green you have, the more active the developer you are.

This blog was created by forking the minimal mistakes theme, and there was an issue that when I commit this repository, grass was not filled. I'm not sure it's because it's a fork, but I figured out how to make it.

You need to create another repository for this blog repository, and delete the folked one. Before delete it, make sure you have it in your computer. Once delete it, push your blog repository to new repository. Then the issue will be solved.
