Finally figured out how to post images.

You will see assets folder and add images folder in there and import image files.

```markdown
<!-- ![rel](img file path) -->

![image-test](/assets/images/2024-02-24-imagePost/test.png)
```

![image-test](/assets/images/2024-02-24-imagePost/test.png)

I will post with images from now on.
