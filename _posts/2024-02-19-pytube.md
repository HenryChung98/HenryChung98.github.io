Downloading a video from YouTube is quite a tough job. Download extensions to download YouTube videos or use another website to get the video.\n

However, you can do it easily using python with pytube which is lightweight, dependency-free Python library.

You need to intall the library.

```bash
pip3 install pytube
```

and import

```python
import pytube
```

Almost there. Now we need to take input the URL.

```python
link = input("past the URL: ")
```

After, we can use this code to convert the URL into link and download the video.

```python
video = pytube.YouTube(link)
video.streams.first().download()
```

That's pretty much.
