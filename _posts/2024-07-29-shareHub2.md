### Post Model

```python
class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    content = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

ForeignKey is the field type provided by Django's ORM, which establishes a one-to-many relationship with other models, where ForeignKey represents a reference to the User model.
