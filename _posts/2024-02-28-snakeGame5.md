#### difficulty level

It is a bit boring if there is no any difficulty changed, so I decided to make the snake faster depending on the score.

I will make a variable for game speed and modify the clock.tick() function.

```python
game_speed = 10
.
.
.
clock.tick(game_speed)
```

and write a short code like

```python
if food.score % 5 == 0:
    game_speed += 5
```

If I write this code in the main function, it will be called per a millisecond until score is divided by 5, so I need one variable.

```python
is_increase = False

if abs(snake.body[0][0] - food.x) < scale and abs(snake.body[0][1] - food.y) < scale:
    food.new_location()
    snake.grow()
    food.score +=  1
    if food.score % 5 == 0:
        is_increase = True


if is_increase == True and food.score % 5 == 0:
    game_speed += 5
    is_increase = False
```

#### best score

I will use fstream method to get the best score. file is always string, so you need to be careful when you compare, get, or assign it.

Add code to record best score in game_over().

```python
if int(b_score) < food.score:
    with open('best-score.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(food.score))
```

and get best score from the file. There is no file very first time obviously, so I write code for writing file in except.

```python
try:
    with open('best-score.txt', 'r') as file:
        best_score = int(file.read())
except:
    with open('best-score.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("0")
```

and display the best score

```python
def show_best_score(b_score):
    font = pygame.font.SysFont("Copperplate Gothic Bold", 30)
    text = font.render("Best Score: " + str(b_score), True, (255, 255, 255))
    display.blit(text, (10, 30))
```
