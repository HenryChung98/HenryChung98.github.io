### introduction

NumPy(Numerical Python) is a powerful numerical library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

As it is libary, you need to import it

```python
import numpy as np
```

### code

#### simple codes

```python
array1 = np.array([2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 13]) # one-dimensional array
array2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]) # two-dimensional array

print(type(array1)) # numpy.ndarray(n dimensional array)
print(type(array2)) # numpy.ndarray(n dimensional array)

print(array1.shape) # (6,)
print(array2.shape) # (3, 4)

print(array1.size) # 6
print(array2.size) # 12
```

#### several methods

full
You can create an array with a specified shape(number) and fill it with a constant value.

```python
array1 = numpy.full(6, 7)
print(array1) # [7 7 7 7 7 7]
```

There is an another method which works similarly to full.

```python
array0 = numpy.zeros(6, dtype=int)
array1 = numpy.ones(6, dtype=int)

print(array0) # [0 0 0 0 0 0]
print(array1) # [1 1 1 1 1 1]
```

arange
Pretty similar to how for loop range works

```python
array1 = numpy.arange(6)

print(array1) # [0 1 2 3 4 5]
```

#### indexing, slicing

indexing
It is no different from normal indexing, but there is a few things that can be done only with numpy.

```python
array1 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13])

print(array1[0]) # 2
print(array1[-1]) # 13
print(array1[[1, 3, 4]]) # [3(1st index), 5(3rd index), 7(4th index)]

array2 = np.array([2, 1, 3])

print(array1[array2]) # same as array1[2, 1, 3], so it will be [4(2nd index), 3(1st index)), 5(3rd index)]

```

slicing
Same as normal slicing.

```python
array1 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13])

print(array1[2:5]) # [4, 5, 7]
print(array1[:5]) # [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
print(array1[2:6:2]) # [4, 6]
```
