#### death function

Everything works except death function. When snake collides with wall or its body, game should be over. This code is for checking collision with wall. I wrote code like this for test, may need to modify later.

```python
if snake.body[0][0] < -10 or snake.body[0][1] < -10:
    print("dead")
    pygame.time.delay(2000)
if snake.body[0][0] > screen_width or snake.body[0][1] > screen_height:
    print("dead")
    pygame.time.delay(2000)
```

And this code is for checking collision with its body.

```python
i = snake.length - 1
while i > 0:
    # if head collided to body, dead.
    if abs(snake.body[0][0] - snake.body[i][0]) < snake.w and abs(snake.body[0][1] - snake.body[i][1] < snake.h) and snake.length > 2:
        print("dead")
    i -= 1
```

##### Learned New

I realized that snake shouldn't be turned 180 degrees so I need to modify keydown functions

```python
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
            if not(snake.x_dir == 0 and snake.y_dir == 1):
                snake.x_dir = 0
                snake.y_dir = -1

        if event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
            if not(snake.x_dir == 0 and snake.y_dir == -1):
                snake.x_dir = 0
                snake.y_dir = 1

        if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
            if not(snake.x_dir == 1 and snake.y_dir == 0):
                snake.x_dir = -1
                snake.y_dir = 0

        if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
            if not(snake.x_dir == -1 and snake.y_dir == 0):
                snake.x_dir = 1
                snake.y_dir = 0
```
