#### death function

Everything works except death function. When snake collides with wall or its body, game should be over. This code is for checking collision with wall. I wrote code like this for test, may need to modify later.

```python
if snake.body[0][0] < -10 or snake.body[0][1] < -10:
    print("dead")
    pygame.time.delay(2000)
if snake.body[0][0] > screen_width or snake.body[0][1] > screen_height:
    print("dead")
    pygame.time.delay(2000)
```

And this code is for checking collision with its body.

```python
i = snake.length - 1
while i > 0:
    # if head collided to body, dead.
    if abs(snake.body[0][0] - snake.body[i][0]) < snake.w and abs(snake.body[0][1] - snake.body[i][1] < snake.h) and snake.length > 2:
        print("dead")
    i -= 1
```
